 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
 COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
 COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO
 BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE
 CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED
 HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
    "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
 other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative
 work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic
 work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations
 or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted
 including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a
 work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for
 the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a
 musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
 timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
 Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
    "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
 encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or
 other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below,
 which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents,
 constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
 entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each
 constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together
 are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection
 will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the purposes of
 this License.
    "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed at
 http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by
 Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this License, including,
 at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that have the same
 purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of this License; and,
 (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of adaptations of works made
 available under that license under this License or a Creative Commons
 jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this License.
    "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
 copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other
 transfer of ownership.
    "License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes as
 selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License:
 Attribution, ShareAlike.
    "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that
 offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
    "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the
 individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no
 individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i)
 in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and
 other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or
 otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore;
 (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal
 entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and,
 (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the
 broadcast.
    "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms
 of this License including without limitation any production in the literary,
 scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its
 expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other
 writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a
 dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in
 dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic
 work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
 cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture,
 engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works
 expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an
 illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to
 geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast;
 a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a
 copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to
 the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
    "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
 who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to
 the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
 exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
    "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and
 to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or
 process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances;
 to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the
 public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually
 chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process
 and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work,
 including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the
 Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
    "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including
 without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation
 and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected
 performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.
 .
 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
 limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
 limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
 copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise
 the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
    to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
 Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
    to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
 including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly
 label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the
 original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work
 was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate
 "The original work has been modified.";
    to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
 Collections; and,
    to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
 .
    For the avoidance of doubt:
       Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
 which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
 licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right
 to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
 under this License;
       Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
 the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
 scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect
 such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this
 License; and,
       Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
 royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a
 member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes,
 via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this
 License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known
 or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
 modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
 media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted
 by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
 subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
    You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
 this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier
 (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
 Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that
 restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the
 Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
 License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices
 that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every
 copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
 Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
 measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work
 from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
 the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a
 Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work
 itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
 Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
 practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section
 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any
 Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any
 credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
    You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the
 terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the
 same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction
 license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same
 License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US));
 (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation
 under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms
 of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the
 licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you
 must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the
 following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the
 Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or
 Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the
 Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability
 of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that
 recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep
 intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the
 disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the
 Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or
 Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective
 technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a
 recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that
 recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b)
 applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not
 require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject
 to the terms of the Applicable License.
    If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
 Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section
 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable
 to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original
 Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original
 Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
 institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
 Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
 reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the
 Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
 any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI
 does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the
 Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an
 Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation
 (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
 based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this
 Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,
 that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit
 will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or
 Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least
 as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the
 avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for
 the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising
 Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert
 or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original
 Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
 use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of
 the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
    Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
 otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
 Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
 Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory
 action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original
 Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions
 (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of
 this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a
 distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial
 to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or
 not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by
 the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right
 under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
 otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
 CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
 WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
 DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
 DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
 WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
 IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
 SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING
 OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
 ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
    This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
 automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
 Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from
 You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
 provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those
 licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this
 License.
    Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
 under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
 provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
 License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
 under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
 force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
    Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
 the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms
 and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
    Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
 offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and
 conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
    If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
 applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
 remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
 parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
 extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
    No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
 breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and
 signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
    This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
 respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
 or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor
 shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
 communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual
 written agreement of the Licensor and You.
    The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
 License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for
 the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the
 WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
 Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter
 take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are
 sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
 implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If
 the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes
 additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are
 deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to
 restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.
