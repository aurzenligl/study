# A long, long time ago
# There lived a Civilization of great power.
# They built a city, and within that city they built
# a palace. They held sacred the secrets of
# the Holy Cross, and understood the plainer
# nature of reality. They ventured to the far shore
# and sought power from the spaces between.
