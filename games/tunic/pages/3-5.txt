A long, long time ago
There lived a Civilization of great power.
They built a city, and within that city they built
a palace. They held sacred the secrets of
the Holy Cross, and understood the planar
nature of reality. They ventured to the far shore
and sought power from the spaces between.

As is usual, an alluring old power was discovered.
Fossils of self, annealed visions of the future,
entombed and cast into sarcophagi and buried.
A lever in the canonical plane, a store of
potential. Perhaps it is the fabled prize,
The Power To Defy Death.

A Terrible Power Rises
The discovering Hero opened a tomb and revealed
a terrible truth. A Cathedral was built
to venerate this new origin of life, and the
faithful were granted the curse of holy oblivion.

The World Is Thrown Into Ruin
The lever overworked! The fulcrum shattered! A hole in
truth will thunder open and all manner of disquiet
contradictions will gnaw apart the canonical plane.
The thread is snagged into a squirming coil, with
no beginning and no end. Flee to your arcs,
old ones, and become your predestined selves!

A Prison & A Beacon
... but one must live outside the shivering ring,
The Heir seeking an Heir-To-The-Heir.
A beacon to bring about a ruin seeker.
To either grow strong and replace an ailing heir,
or to hold sacred Holy Cross, and ensure
their wisdom lives on.

Awaiting a Worthy Successor
witch will you be, ruin seeker? Have you arrived here
seeking treasure and glory? Or do you seek to
uncover deeper truths? Look carefully, for
The Golden Path lies everywhere...
